# Minecraft Turtle Programs

This is a collection of several Minecraft ComputerCraft turtle programs.



## Dig.lua
dig.lua will make the turtle mine a square of length "x" read from user input.

It will mine from y-axis 50 to 10, under the assumption that the user input for the current y-value is correct.

### bugs

1) The turtle occassionally gets lost and eventually mines in a straight line until it reaches an unloaded chunk.
